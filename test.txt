They typically include phrases such as:\n- "I don\'t know..."\n- "I can\'t provide information about..."\n- "It is not stated..."\n- "There is no answer"\n- "There is no information..."\n- Or other synonymous expressions indicating uncertainty or lack of information\n\nAny response that provides concrete information or a direct answer, even if brief, should be classified as an answer.\nUse 0 for answers and 1 for non-answers in the \'non_answer\' field.\n\nFor each response, provide a classification in the following JSON format:\n\n{\'description\': \'Classify if the answer is a non-answer.\', \'properties\': {\'rationale\': {\'title\': \'Rationale\', \'type\': \'string\'}, \'non_answer\': {\'enum\': [0, 1], \'title\': \'Non Answer\', \'type\': \'integer\'}}, \'required\': [\'rationale\', \'non_answer\'], \'title\': \'ClassifiedAnswer\', \'type\': \'object\'}\n\n## Examples\n\nResponse: The information provided does not mention anything about compulsory elective modules or the number of free modules a student can choose from in the M.Sc. Data Science program at Marburg University.\nClassification: {\'rationale\': \'The response indicates a lack of information, which is characteristic of a non-answer.\', \'non_answer\': 1}\n\n\nResponse: The question is not clear because there is no specific module mentioned. The text only talks about enrollment as a doctoral student and provides information about the required documents and the enrollment process. It does not mention a specific module.\nClassification: {\'rationale\': \'The response states that specific information is not provided, making it a non-answer.\', \'non_answer\': 1}\n\n\nResponse: Master of Science (M.Sc.)\nClassification: {\'rationale\': \'The response provides a specific piece of information, making it a valid answer.\', \'non_answer\': 0}\n\n\n\n<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n## Task\nNow, classify the following response:\nResponse: \n\nBased on the story, Cotton was white.\nClassification:\n\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>']

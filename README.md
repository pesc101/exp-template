## 🚀 Initialization

### 📦 UV

To initialize the environment using `uv`, run the following command:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12p
uv sync
```

## ⚡ Usage

When using this template you have to declare all your configuration parameters in the `conf/defaults.yaml` file. Also modify the `conf/model/defaults.yaml` and `conf/data/defaults.yaml` files to fit your needs.

### Run LLM

To run a LLM you can use config from the launch.json file. If you want to run it without it you can use the following command:

```bash
 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 uv run start_vllm_server_as_process.py model=qwen2-7B  
```

### Run Evaluation
To run the execution of the model you can use the following command:

```bash
uv run src/scivqa/evaluation/execution.py
```

If something broke in the evaluation you can use the following command to run the evaluation again:

```bash
uv run src/scivqa/evaluation/evaluate.py
```

But you have to change the `output_folder` in the `defaults.yaml` to the folder where the execution results are stored.
